# AI-Enhanced DevOps for Java Developers

This project demonstrates practical implementation of AI tools and techniques in a Java DevOps pipeline, as discussed in the blog post "Harnessing AI in DevOps: A Modern Approach for Java Developers Using Generative AI and SLMs".

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Java web application along with AI-enhanced DevOps tools that demonstrate:

1. AI-assisted code generation and review
2. Predictive test failure analysis
3. Automated documentation generation
4. AI-powered pipeline optimization
5. Integration with SLMs for natural language processing of logs and alerts

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `mvn install`
3. Configure the AI services in `application.properties`
4. Run the development server: `mvn spring-boot:run`
5. Run the DevOps pipeline: `./run-pipeline.sh`
